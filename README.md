Lodge Financial Dashboard
Overview
This is a single-page web application designed to help lodge administrators track and manage member dues and lodge expenses in real-time. It provides a simple, three-view interface: a financial Dashboard for overall balance, a Dues Roster for member management, and an Expenses Log.
The application uses GitHub Pages for deployment and Google Cloud's Firestore (via the Canvas environment) for all persistent, real-time data storage, ensuring data integrity and instant updates.

Record new payments and automatically update the Year-To-Date (YTD) Paid summary for each member.
